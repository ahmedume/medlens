          MediTrust helps clinicians and researchers review published evidence. It retrieves articles from
          PubMed, applies a structured trust-scoring model, and produces downloadable reports with
          verdicts, bias notes, and contradiction summaries.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white lg:text-3xl">Trust scoring</h2>
        <p>
          Scores combine study type weighting (RCT and systematic reviews rank highest), source tier
          (PubMed and peer-reviewed journals vs blogs), sample-size signals from abstracts, and
          publication recency. Every score includes a written explanation of how it was derived.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white lg:text-3xl">How it works</h2>
        <p>
          Each search runs through literature retrieval, evidence scoring, report assembly, and optional
          PDF export. Results are intended for research review, not patient-specific decisions.
